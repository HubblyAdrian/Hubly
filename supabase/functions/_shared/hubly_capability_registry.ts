// supabase/functions/_shared/hubly_capability_registry.ts
//
// The Hubly Capability Registry — owned by the Hubly platform, not by any
// one interface. This is Hubly Core infrastructure.
//
// Not the legacy hubly_brain_capabilities.ts. That file belongs to the frozen
// Legacy Brain architecture and must not be extended or reused here — this is
// a deliberately separate, new registry.
//
// Shape: a Capability is a named area of what Hubly can do (Website, Booking,
// CRM, Marketing, ...). A Capability exposes one or more named Actions — the
// concrete, callable operations within it (e.g. Website: analyze, generate,
// update, publish). Consumers (the Hubly Conversation service today; the
// dashboard, Studio, Marketplace, or a future Hubly agent tomorrow) ask
// "which capability solves this?" and then invoke one of its actions. The
// registry doesn't know or care who's asking.
//
// Rules this file exists to satisfy:
// - Every capability and action is defined in exactly one place: this file.
//   Nothing about what a capability does is duplicated anywhere else — any
//   consumer's prompt/UI text describing available capabilities is generated
//   FROM this registry, never hand-written to describe it.
// - This registry dispatches; it never implements. An action's handler either
//   calls an existing backend service (that service remains the source of
//   truth) or, if no real backend exists yet, returns an honest "not real
//   yet" result. `real` must be revisited the moment the underlying
//   capability actually gets built — a stale `real:false` is the same
//   failure mode as fabricated analysis, just delayed.
// - Adding a Hubly Core capability (or a new action on an existing one) means
//   adding one entry here. No consumer's orchestration logic should ever
//   need to change to support it.
//
// Current scope note: capability/action names below cover only what's real
// today (website analysis, and honest stopgaps for social/listing analysis).
// The mapping of these names onto the full 14-group Hubly Core list is not
// finalized — that's a product-design decision, not something to lock in
// here. New capabilities (booking, crm, marketing, ...) get added as they're
// actually built, per "build on demand," not stubbed in speculatively.
